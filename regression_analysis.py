# First, you will need to install the plotly library. You can do this by running the following command:
!pip install plotly

# Next, you will need to import the necessary libraries and modules. In addition to plotly, you will also need to import pandas and sklearn:
import plotly.express as plotly
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import linear_model

# Load your data into a Pandas DataFrame. You can do this using the read_csv function from pandas.
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Next, you will need to select the columns that you want to use for your regression analysis. Let's say that you want to use the columns X and Y as your independent and dependent variables, respectively. You can select these columns using the following code:
X = df[['X']]
y = df['Y']

# Create a linear regression model using the LinearRegression class from sklearn.
model = linear_model.LinearRegression()

# Train the model on your data using the fit method.
model.fit(X, y)

# Use the predict method to make predictions on new data.
predictions = model.predict(X)

# Now, you can use plotly to plot the regression line and the data points. You can do this using the scatter function, passing in the columns X and Y as the x and y arguments, respectively.
fig = plotly.scatter(df, x='X', y='Y')

# Finally, you can add the regression line to the plot by using the add_shape function and passing in the x and y coordinates of the line:
# Get the slope and intercept of the line
slope = model.coef_[0]
intercept = model.intercept_

# Generate the x and y coordinates for the line
x_values = [df['X'].min(), df['X'].max()]
y_values = [slope * x + intercept for x in x_values]

# Add the line to the plot
fig.add_shape(
    type='line',
    x0=x_values[0],
    y0=y_values[0],
    x1=x_values[1],
    y1=y_values[1],
    xref='x',
    yref='y'
)

# Display the plot
fig.show()
